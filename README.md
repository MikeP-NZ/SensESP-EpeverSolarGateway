# SensESP-EpeverSolarGateway
A SenseESP sensor that uses ModbusRTU client to read data from an Epever Solar Charge Controller and passes it on to a SignalK Server.

This code is working for me but is not a finished and well  documented project.  Feel free to help me improve it.

It is run on an ESP32 DEVK1tc_V4 with an RS485 to TTL converter on pins 16/17 which is connected to the pins A,B and Gnd pins of an RJ485 socket of an Epever solar charge controller (Model Tracer 2206AN)
